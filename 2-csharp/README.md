# C# Crash Course

In this C# Crash Course, we'll go over the basics of C# so that you'll be ready to build out exciting web apps in emails 3, 4, and 5! We'll start by going through the key attributes of C#, syntax basics, and introduce you to OOP. At the end, we'll link you to some quick in-browser C# challenges so you can apply these concepts.

# Let's get into it!
## Language Attributes
C# is a strongly typed, compiled, object oriented language. Let's break this down.
* In a **strongly typed** language, every variable has a defined type. Every method declaration specifies a name, the type and kind for each input parameter and for the return value.
* A **compiler** converts the code you write into a format that your computer can understand.After you write C# and build it, the C# compiler (called Roslyn) will analyze your code to check for any errors.

## Syntax Basics
Here's a piece of code that will print "Hello world!" to the console.

```csharp
using System;

Console.WriteLine("Hello world!");
```
### Keywords
With C#, you use **keywords** like *using* and *Console*.
>Keywords are predefined, reserved identifiers that have special meanings to the compiler.

### Accessing methods
The Dot in *Console.WriteLine* allows us to access methods and properties. In this example, **Console** is a type that represents the console window. **WriteLine** is a method of the Console type that prints a line of text to that text console.

### Parameters


...
## OOP
C# is an object-oriented language. You define types and their behavior.
